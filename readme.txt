Find and fix topical gaps in your SEO Content. Rank higher on search.

== Description ==

Topic SEO Content Optimization Tool is a plugin that shows you the key topics you need to cover to maximize your search ranking for a post. Simply enter the keyword your post is targeting, and our AI analyzes the top-performing content in Google to extract exactly what your audience expects to read about and show you what your content is missing.

This plugin is tied to a Raptive account.

You must have a Raptive account or be working on a Raptive site in order to use this plugin.

= Interactive Grader =
Our easy-to-use grader updates in real time as you edit the content. Clicking any of the topics shows you how they are used in competing content so you can quickly learn the context.

= Questions to Answer =
See what questions your readers are asking related to your keyword. Answering these questions increases the value of your content and makes you more likely to rank for Google\'s People Also Ask box.

= Outlines of Top Content =
Choose the best headings and subheadings for your article based on outlines of top-ranking content. Easily see how others have broken down a complex subject into more manageable pieces.

== Installation ==

Installing this plugin will allow you to get recommendations from your Topic content brief in the sidebar of the Gutenberg or Classic editor.

= Installation =

Simply click the \"Install Now\" button and log in using your Raptive account.

= Need a Raptive Account? =

Go to the [Raptive homepage](https://raptive.com/) to apply for an account.

= Where can I find the plugin after it's installed? =

The Topic plugin is visible in the top right of the screen when creating or editing a post in the Gutenberg editor. Click the Topic logo to open the sidebar.

In the Classic Editor, a button labeled "Grade Content" should open the sidebar.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this plugin slow down my site? =

This plugin only adds functionality to the administrator side of WordPress so it will not impact your site's performance for visitors in any way. We've also done extensive testing to confirm that site performance is unaffected.

= Why use the plugin? =

Avoid switching back and forth between tabs and copying and pasting your content from place to place. With the plugin, all the tools you need to optimize your content are right in the WordPress editor.

= Can my entire team use the plugin to optimize content? =

Yes! Anyone using the plugin can log in using their Raptive dashboard account. Email support@raptive.com to create additional users for writers and editors — our SEO-assistant user option gives access to only the Content Optimization features in your dashboard.

Alternatively, your team members can click "Load Brief" and paste the URL of any content brief you've created, to optimize and grade that content without logging in.

= Can I try it for free? =

Yes, give it a try on a sample brief, just click "Load Brief" and paste in the following URL: https://app.usetopic.com/briefs/0231ed19/overview
